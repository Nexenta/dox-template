# Dox Template

A simple template for use with the [dox](http://github.com/visionmedia/dox) documentation library.

Currently this is very rough and could do with a tidy up, just putting it here so it is easy for other people to make changes etc.

## Usage

    dox < your-lib.js | dox-template -r 0.0.1 > docs/index.html

## Examples

This is currently in use for [davis.js api documentation](http://olivernn.github.com/davis.js/docs/) and for [splunk docs](http://splunk.github.com/splunk-sdk-javascript/docs/0.1.0/index.html).
